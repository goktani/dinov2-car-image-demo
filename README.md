# DINOv2 Car Image Classification Demo

**DINOv2 car classification demo – results under review**

This repository demonstrates fine-tuning and testing of the DINOv2 vision model for car image classification. The codebase includes both Python scripts and a step-by-step notebook. **Note:** The results in this repo are preliminary—either the DINOv2 model experienced overfitting or the dataset used was not sufficiently diverse. After presenting this demo to my supervisor, I plan to iterate and improve on the methodology based on received feedback.

## Model Improvements & Fine-Tuning Strategy

This model extends DINOv2 with the following improvements for the car classification task:

- Fine-tuned on a custom dataset with 44 car models.
- Initial training on only the final (head) layer.
- Full network fine-tuning with data augmentation techniques.
- Early stopping applied during training; best weights saved.
- Final accuracy evaluated on held-out test data.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dinov2-car-image-demo.git
cd dinov2-car-image-demo
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install torch torchvision
```
Ek olarak, Jupyter Notebook/Colab üzerinde çalışmak için:
```bash
pip install notebook  # veya Google Colab'da doğrudan açabilirsiniz
```

> **Note**: Make sure you have [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) installed to properly download the model weights `.pt` file.

---

## Usage

### 1. Jupyter/Colab Notebook

- **Recommended for step-by-step execution and exploration.**
- Open `Dinov2_demo0.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, or Google Colab.

### 2. Run Python Scripts

- For training/testing via script (batch execution):
    ```bash
    python dinov2demo0.py
    ```
- For alternative testing workflow:
    ```bash
    python testv0.py
    ```

### 3. Input Images & Dataset

- Place your own test images in the `test_images/` or `test_imagesv0/` folders.
- Dataset version 2 should be under `datasetv2/`.

### 4. Outputs

- `output.png`, `output2.png`, and `output3.png` are visual results of model predictions.
- `test_predictions.csv` records predicted class labels for the test images.

---

## Results

- **Current model performance is not final.**
- DINOv2 showed either overfitting or the dataset failed to support generalization.
- Performance numbers (accuracy, loss curves, etc.) are available in notebook outputs and `.csv` results.
- See output images for sample predictions.

---

## Known Issues / Limitations

- Model may significantly overfit on the provided dataset.
- Dataset might not be sufficiently large or diverse for robust training.
- Results should **not** be considered as a final deployment or representative benchmark.
- Further validation and testing with better data and/or augmented strategies are required.

---

## Planned Improvements

- Incorporate supervisor/engineer feedback to improve model and workflow.
- Experiment with data augmentation and more dataset cleaning.
- Try alternative DINOv2 configurations, regularization, and batch/epoch tuning.
- Compare with other vision transformer architectures.
- Enhance evaluation with cross-validation and additional metrics.
